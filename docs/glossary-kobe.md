Wordform
----------------

In linguistics, the different ways that a word can exist in a language. (Not to be confused with [lemma] – which is its own special type of wordform). A wordform _must_ be able to exist by itself.

Stem
----------------

In linguistics, the root of a word (from which all inflected forms are based off of). As a rule of practice, we – as linguists – aim for the lemma to be a wordform in and of itself.
