Conjugator
==========
[Conjugator]: #conjugator

(_informal_) a tool that generates a [paradigm][].

N.B.: people ask for a conjugator, even when asking to generate noun
wordform!


Translation
===========

[translation]: #translation

A [definition][] written in a different language than the [head][]
it is defining.


Gloss
=====
[gloss]: #gloss

> Note: use [translation][] instead!

Sometimes a sloppy synonym for [translation][].
More specifically, a _gloss_ is a one-to-one
mapping between one language and another, often accompanied by relevant
[tags][] for [morphosyntactic features][]. Glosses are more
specific and less "fluent" than a [translation][].


Normatize
=========
[normatize]: #normatize

Write things according to the orthographical _norm_. A norm is
implicitly and unconsciously decided by a community of writers. To
normalize the spelling of something is to make it match the spelling
expected by a community. A language may have many norms.

See also: [standardize][]

- e.g., the normative form of "alot" is "a lot"
- e.g., the normative form of "icecream" is "ice cream"
- e.g., the normative form of "atchakosuk" is "ac√¢hkosak"


Standardize
===========
[standardize]: #standardize

Write things according to the orthographical _standard_. A standard is
explicitly and consciously decided by an individual or body to be
adopted by a greater community. A language may have many standards, or
it might have no standard orthography. When there is one widely-adopted
standard, then it is also the norm: then "standardize" and "normative"
are synonymous.
