Conjugator
==========
[Conjugator]: #conjugator

(_informal_) a tool that generates a [paradigm][].

N.B.: people ask for a conjugator, even when asking to generate noun
wordform!


Translation
===========

[translation]: #translation

A [definition][] written in a different language than the [head][]
it is defining.


Gloss
=====
[gloss]: #gloss

> Note: use [translation][] instead!

Sometimes a sloppy synonym for [translation][].
More specifically, a _gloss_ is a one-to-one
mapping between one language and another, often accompanied by relevant
[tags][] for [morphosyntactic features][]. Glosses are more
specific and less "fluent" than a [translation][].
